# Per project gRPC-Quest - The Quest of gRPC
## _Abstract_
_REST_, _gRPC_ and _GraphQL_ are the three ubiquitous API technologies. There have been articles [1, 2] comparing the three, and suggesting when to use which.

This artice is about a pet project evaluating _gRPC_. gRPC also known as Google Remote Procedure Call is an open source remote procedure call system initially developed at Google in 2015 as the next generation of the RPC infrastructure Stubby.
